## 🎯 About This Repository

This repository documents my structured DSA learning journey from **November 2025** through self-learning and systematic practice.

**Journey Goals:**
- Master fundamental data structures and algorithms through pattern recognition
- Solve 500+ problems across all difficulty levels by May 2028
- Build interview-ready problem-solving skills for technical rounds

**Learning Philosophy:**
I don't memorize solutions—I learn **patterns**. Each problem teaches me a reusable approach that applies to dozens of similar problems. This repository showcases understanding, not just code.

## ⚡ Complexity Cheat Sheet

A summary of the time/space tradeoffs I have analyzed and implemented so far.

| Pattern/Topic | Best Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Example Problems |
|:--------------|:---------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|
| **Digit Extraction** | $O(\log_{10} n)$ | $O(1)$ | Palindrome, Armstrong Number |
| **Euclidean Algorithm** | $O(\log(\min(a, b)))$ | $O(1)$ | GCD/HCF, LCM |
| **Divisors Check** | $O(\sqrt{n})$ | $O(1)$ | Print Divisors, Prime Check |
| **Cycle Detection** | $O(n)$ | $O(1)$ | Happy Number (Floyd's Cycle) |
| **Two Pointers** | $O(n)$ | $O(1)$ | Squares of Sorted Array (Optimized) |
| **Frequency Map** | $O(n)$ | $O(1)$ (fixed alphabet) | First Unique Character |

## 🎓 Learning Approach

### Pattern-First Methodology

I follow a **pattern-first learning approach** instead of randomly solving problems:

**My Workflow for Each Problem:**
1. **Study the pattern** (5-15 min) - Learn the PATTERN, not just the solution
2. **Attempt to code independently** - Apply the pattern on my own
3. **Create 5-10 test cases locally** - Test edge cases before submitting
4. **Submit to LeetCode** - Only after local tests pass (this improved my acceptance rate from 52.9% to 64.52%)
5. **Read 2-3 alternative solutions** - Understand different approaches
6. **Document the pattern** - Note when to use this approach again as well as the new optimized solution approach

**Why This Works:**
- Optimal DSA solutions are **LEARNED, not discovered**
- Trying to "figure out" patterns independently wastes time and causes frustration
- Learning patterns once applies to dozens of problems
- Understanding WHY a solution works > memorizing code

### Multiple Solutions = Optimization Mindset

**7 problems in this repo have multiple solution approaches (8 optimized files):**
- LCM: Brute force → Mathematical formula using GCD
- Contains Duplicate: Three approaches (HashSet contains, sorting, HashSet.add())
- Happy Number: HashSet cycle detection → O(1) space using math property
- Perfect Number: O(n) → O(√n) optimization
- Squares of Sorted Array: ArrayList + sort → Two-pointer O(n)
- First Unique Character: Two approaches (indexOf comparison, frequency array)
- Print Divisors: O(n) brute force → O(√n) optimization

**This demonstrates:** Understanding time/space tradeoffs, not just "getting it accepted"

## 📚 What I've Learned

### Patterns (17/17 Complete) ✅

**Mastered Pattern-Solving Framework:**
- Analyzed structure: rows, columns, what changes per row
- Derived formulas instead of memorizing patterns
- Common formulas: `2*i+1` (odd numbers), `n-i-1` (centering), `i>n ? formula2 : formula1` (diamond logic)
- Documented universal rules in `PATTERN_RULES.txt`

### Basic Maths (26/26 Complete) ✅

**Core Patterns Learned:**
- **Digit Extraction:** `n % 10` (last digit), `n / 10` (remove last digit)
- **Euclidean Algorithm:** GCD using recursion - `gcd(a,b) = gcd(b, a%b)`
- **Mathematical Properties:** LCM formula `(a*b)/GCD`, Digital Root using `mod 9`
- **Square Root Optimization:** O(√n) for divisor problems (used in 3 problems)

### Java Collections Framework (9/9 Mastered) ✅

**Comprehensive Understanding:**
- **List:** ArrayList (Random access) vs LinkedList (Insertion)
- **Set:** HashSet (Unordered) vs TreeSet (Sorted)
- **Map:** HashMap (Speed) vs TreeMap (Order)
- **Advanced:** Custom `Comparator` implementation and `hashCode()` overrides.

## 🔧 Problem-Solving Workflow

### Before Starting Any Problem

1. **Identify the category** - Array? String? Math? Tree?
2. **Read problem constraints** - Input size tells you acceptable time complexity
3. **Think of brute force first** - Always have a working solution
4. **Check if pattern exists** - Have I seen this before?

### While Solving

5. **Code the approach** - Write clean, commented code
6. **Create test cases** - Think of edge cases:
   - Empty input
   - Single element
   - All same elements
   - Negative numbers (if applicable)
   - Maximum constraints
7. **Test locally** - Run through all test cases in IDE

### After Solving

9. **Submit to LeetCode** - Only after local tests pass
10. **Analyze complexity** - Calculate time and space
11. **Optimize if possible** - Can time or space be improved?

## 📖 Resources

### Primary Learning Resources

**Self-Learning Resources**
- Approach: Structured DSA curriculum focusing on patterns, not just solutions
- Why: Understanding patterns builds real problem-solving skills

**LeetCode**
- Profile: [@Mikky_mlh](https://leetcode.com/u/Mikky_mlh/)
- How I use: Problem practice, reading alternative solutions

**Visualization Tools (Upcoming)**
- As I move into Recursion, I will be using recursion tree diagrams to visualize stack trace execution.

### Why Java?

**Reasons I chose Java for DSA:**
1. **Explicit typing teaches precision** - Forces understanding of data types
2. **Industry standard in India** - LEGACY CODE
3. **Strong Collections Framework** - Rich built-in data structures
4. **Preparation for production code** - Real-world applications use Java

## ⚠️ Important Note

### About Copying Solutions

**This repository contains MY solutions after learning patterns from educational resources.**

**If you're here to copy-paste for LeetCode submissions:**
- You're sabotaging your own learning
- You won't learn the patterns needed for interviews
- Companies will expose this in technical rounds immediately

**My approach:** Pattern recognition through systematic learning. I study patterns from various resources, code independently, test locally, then submit. This builds real problem-solving skills.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Next Steps

**Right Now (Dec 23-31, 2025):**
- Starting **Basic Recursion** (7 problems)
- Understanding recursion patterns: base cases, recursive cases, call stack
- Target: 5-7 recursion problems by Dec 31

**January 2026:**
- Complete Basic Recursion
- Start Basic Hashing (6 problems)
- Begin transitioning to Medium difficulty
