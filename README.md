## 💡 Problem-Solving Approach

1. **Understand** - Read problem carefully, identify inputs/outputs
2. **Examples** - Work through examples by hand
3. **Approach** - Think of brute force first, then optimize
4. **Code** - Implement solution
5. **Test** - Verify with test cases
6. **Analyze** - Calculate time and space complexity
7. **Optimize** - Can it be improved?
8. **Learn** - Read alternative solutions
